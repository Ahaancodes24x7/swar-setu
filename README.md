## 🧠 About The Project

**SwarSetu** is a multimodal, multilingual AI-powered platform designed to assist in the **early detection and support of specific learning disabilities**.

We aim to bridge the gap between students, parents, and educators by focusing on:
*   **Dyslexia** (Reading difficulty)
*   **Dyscalculia** (Math difficulty)
*   **Dysgraphia** (Writing difficulty)

The platform focuses on **early intervention**, creating an inclusive digital ecosystem where every learner—regardless of cognitive differences—receives timely support and equal opportunities to succeed.
